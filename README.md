Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Overview:

This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors web-based game featuring a fun Star Wars-themed interface.

The game tracks the number of rounds played (excluding ties) and the number of losses.



How to Play:

Click the "Play" button to start the game.

A 3-second countdown will display before the game round begins.

The result of the round will display dynamically:

-ENEMY FELLED: The player wins.

-YOU DIED: The player loses.

-Equal Sign (=): A tie.
